## Getting started

Install the command-line executable `shader` for your current user:

```bash
dart pub global activate shader
```

Now you can use the `shader` CLI tool:

```bash
shader --help
```

**Hint:** If pub binaries are not known to the path, you can also run it by:

```
dart pub global run shader --help
```
